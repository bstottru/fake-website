 <p>This is my website that is all about my journey in teaching myself how to program.</p> 
 <p>It is going to take a lot of effort and patience to teach myself.</p>
<p>I am beginning to program and hope to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>build a portfolio of coding</li>
<li>understand how fullstack development works</li>
<li>get a job where I can work remotely and eventually live full time in another country</li>
</ul>
<p>I am learning how to code from here: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a></p>
